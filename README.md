## Algorithm of Joint Beyesian by Mao Xu


- I have read an article about Joing Beyesian when I was in high school and found repository about programmized version of proving and explaining Joint Beyesian algorithm

- The repository of Mao Xu realizes the algorithm of Joint Beyesian with Matlab and achieve the same result as the paper

### Joint Bayesian

```
"Bayesian Face Revisited: A Joint Formulation"
The classical Bayesian method models the appearance difference between two faces. 
The author observe that this “difference” formulation may reduce the separability between classes. 
Instead of the classical method, author model two faces jointly with an appropriate prior on the face representation. The new joint formulation leads to an EM-like model learning at the training time and an efficient, closed-formed computation at the test time.
